This is a pure vanilla todo app (I'm not using Bootstrap in this case).
I'll be learning:
- How to structure a basic webpage with HTML
  - Items to input data (forms, buttons)
- How to style with CSS
  - Using element selectors (IDs and classes)
- How to manage the app behaviour with JS
  - Functions interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model)
  - Interactivity with event listeners
  - Web storage for local/session storage and persistence
	- session storage will persist in several tabs during the same session
	- local storage will persist even if we reopen the browser
